Dear Reader,
This repository contains the source code for my Master's thesis at NOVA Information Management School (NOVA IMS). The analysis includes exploratory data analysis, the generation of association rules, the meta-analysis, the recommendation system and the hypotheses testing.
Please ensure to run the Jupyter notebooks in the correct order, as dataframes and dictionaries are passed through pickle files between the scripts. Start by running the 01_Exploratory_and_AssociationRules.ipynb notebook. After successfully executing this notebook, proceed with the other two notebooks in sequence.
